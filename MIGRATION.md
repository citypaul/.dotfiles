# Migration Guide: v1.x → v2.0.0

This guide helps you upgrade from the monolithic CLAUDE.md (v1.x) to the modular structure (v2.0.0).

## What Changed

### Before (v1.0.0)
```
~/.claude/
└── CLAUDE.md (1,818 lines - everything in one file)
```

**View v1.0.0 monolithic file:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/intinig/claude.md/blob/v1.0.0/claude/.claude/CLAUDE.md
- Raw download: https://github.com/intinig/claude.md/raw/v1.0.0/claude/.claude/CLAUDE.md

### After (v2.0.0)
```
~/.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md (156 lines - core + quick reference)
└── docs/
    ├── testing.md (238 lines)
    ├── typescript.md (305 lines)
    ├── code-style.md (370 lines)
    ├── workflow.md (671 lines)
    ├── examples.md (118 lines)
    └── working-with-claude.md (74 lines)
```

**Content is identical** - v2.0.0 splits the v1.0.0 monolithic file into modular files with imports. No content was removed or changed, just reorganized.

## Do You Need to Migrate?

### ✅ Your old setup still works

The v1.0.0 monolithic CLAUDE.md continues to work perfectly. You can upgrade when ready.

### ⚠️ You SHOULD migrate if:

- You want faster Claude Code load times (91% reduction: 1,818 → 156 lines)
- You prefer modular, on-demand documentation
- You want easier maintenance and version control

### 🔴 You MUST migrate if:

- You created custom imports referencing the old structure
- You modified CLAUDE.md and want to merge upstream improvements

## Migration Steps

### Option 1: Clean Install (Recommended)

**If you're using the full dotfiles with GNU Stow:**

```bash
# 1. Backup your current setup
cp ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.v1.backup

# 2. Pull latest changes
cd ~/.dotfiles
git pull origin main

# 3. Reinstall (stow will update the files)
stow -R -t ~ claude

# 4. Verify the new structure
ls -la ~/.claude/docs/
```

**If you installed CLAUDE.md manually:**

```bash
# 1. Backup current file
cp ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.v1.backup

# 2. Install new structure
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/intinig/claude.md.git
cd .dotfiles

# 3. Copy all files
cp claude/.claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/
mkdir -p ~/.claude/docs
cp -r claude/.claude/docs/* ~/.claude/docs/

# 4. Copy agents if you want them
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp -r claude/.claude/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
```

### Option 2: Keep v1.0.0 (Stay on old version)

```bash
# Check out v1.0.0 tag explicitly
cd ~/.dotfiles
git checkout v1.0.0

# Or download the specific version
curl -L https://github.com/intinig/claude.md/raw/v1.0.0/claude/.claude/CLAUDE.md \
  -o ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

## Verification

After migration, verify the new structure works:

### 1. Check files exist

```bash
# Main file should be ~156 lines
wc -l ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# Docs directory should have 6 files
ls ~/.claude/docs/
# Should show:
#   code-style.md
#   examples.md
#   testing.md
#   typescript.md
#   workflow.md
#   working-with-claude.md
```

### 2. Test with Claude Code

Open any project in Claude Code and use the `/memory` command:

```
/memory
```

You should see:
- Main CLAUDE.md loaded
- Import references to `@~/.claude/docs/*.md`

When Claude needs detailed information (e.g., testing principles), it will automatically load the relevant doc file.

## Custom Modifications

### If you modified CLAUDE.md in v1.0.0

You have two options:

**Option A: Apply modifications to new structure**

1. Compare your backup to the new files:
```bash
diff ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.v1.backup ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

2. Identify which section your changes belong to
3. Apply changes to the appropriate file:
   - Testing changes → `~/.claude/docs/testing.md`
   - TypeScript changes → `~/.claude/docs/typescript.md`
   - etc.

**Option B: Keep custom instructions separate**

Create a new file for your custom additions:

```bash
# Create custom instructions file
cat > ~/.claude/my-custom-instructions.md << 'EOF'
# My Custom Development Rules

## My Team's Specific Patterns
- Use React Query for all data fetching
- Prefer Tailwind CSS for styling
- etc.
EOF
```

Then import it in your project CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
# In your project's CLAUDE.md
@~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
@~/.claude/my-custom-instructions.md
```

## Import Paths Changed

### ⚠️ Important: Absolute Paths Required

All imports in v2.0.0 use **absolute paths** for dotfiles compatibility:

```markdown
# ❌ v1.0.0 style (if you had custom imports)
See @docs/testing.md

# ✅ v2.0.0 style (required)
See @~/.claude/docs/testing.md
```

**Why?**
The official Claude Code documentation explicitly shows `@~/.claude/...` syntax. Relative path behavior from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is undocumented, so we use absolute paths for reliability.

**If you have custom imports:**
Update them to use absolute paths with the `~` home directory syntax.

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the detailed docs loading"

1. Check files exist:
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/docs/
```

2. Check file permissions:
```bash
chmod 644 ~/.claude/docs/*.md
```

3. Use `/memory` command in Claude Code to see what's loaded

### "My custom changes are gone"

1. Check your backup:
```bash
cat ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.v1.backup
```

2. Manually reapply changes to appropriate modular file

### "Imports not working"

1. Verify you're using absolute paths:
```bash
grep '@~/.claude' ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

2. Check Claude Code version supports imports (recent versions only)

## Rollback

If you need to rollback to v1.0.0:

```bash
# Using git
cd ~/.dotfiles
git checkout v1.0.0
stow -R -t ~ claude

# Or download directly
curl -L https://github.com/intinig/claude.md/raw/v1.0.0/claude/.claude/CLAUDE.md \
  -o ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

# Remove docs directory if you don't want it
rm -rf ~/.claude/docs
```

- **Compare versions**: https://github.com/intinig/claude.md/compare/v1.0.0...v2.0.0

## What's Next

After migrating to v2.0.0, you can:

1. **Customize individual sections** - Edit only the docs you need
2. **Share specific docs** - Link teammates to individual guidelines
3. **Version control changes** - Smaller, focused diffs per topic
4. **Faster Claude Code** - Reduced initial context usage

Welcome to v2.0.0! 🎉
