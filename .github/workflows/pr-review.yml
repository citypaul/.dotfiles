          Review this PR against our quality standards:
          1. TDD Compliance - Every production code change needs tests
          2. Testing Quality - Tests must be behavior-focused (not implementation-focused)
          3. TypeScript Strictness - No \`any\` types, proper type usage
          4. Functional Patterns - No mutation, pure functions, early returns
          5. General Quality - Clean code, no debug statements, security

          - Summary table (category, status, issues count)
          - Critical issues (must fix)
          - High priority issues (should fix)
          - Suggestions (nice to have)
          - What's good about this PR
