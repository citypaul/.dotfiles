# Paul Hammond's dotfiles

Hello there, you're probably here because of the [claude.md file that I have stored here](claude/.claude/CLAUDE.md).

Here's a [YouTube video showing me adding a feature to my personal project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSoeh6K5Fqo) while using this file for context in a Claude Code session:

[![Watch me use my claude.md file to build a real feature](https://img.youtube.com/vi/rSoeh6K5Fqo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSoeh6K5Fqo)

## This repo is my personal dotfiles repo

I was never expecting it to get as much visibility as it suddenly did because I shared the claude.md file with a few people, and it started spreading.

It's a work in progress that I've been using for my own personal project.

If you're interested in more details, feel free to watch the video above.

## Claude Code Slash Commands

This repo also includes custom Claude Code slash commands that enforce the development practices defined in CLAUDE.md:

- `/tdd-guardian` - Enforces strict TDD compliance and behavior-driven testing
- `/ts-enforcer` - Validates TypeScript strict mode and immutability patterns
- `/refactor-scan` - Identifies valuable refactoring opportunities after tests pass
- `/learn` - Captures learnings and updates CLAUDE.md documentation

[Read the full command documentation](claude/.claude/commands/README.md)

You can also [contact me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-hammond-bb5b78251/) if you want. Add me if you want. I'm always happy to discuss this stuff on there!
