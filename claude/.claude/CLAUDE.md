## Core Philosophy

**TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Every single line of production code must be written in response to a failing test. No exceptions. This is not a suggestion or a preference - it is the fundamental practice that enables all other principles in this document.

I follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) with a strong emphasis on behavior-driven testing and functional programming principles. All work should be done in small, incremental changes that maintain a working state throughout development.

## Quick Reference

**Key Principles:**

- Write tests first (TDD)
- Test behavior, not implementation
- No `any` types or type assertions
- Immutable data only
- Small, pure functions
- TypeScript strict mode always
- Use real schemas/types in tests, never redefine them

**Preferred Tools:**

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Testing**: Jest/Vitest + React Testing Library
- **State Management**: Prefer immutable patterns

## Testing Principles

**Core principle**: Test behavior, not implementation. 100% coverage through business behavior.

**Quick reference:**
- Write tests first (TDD non-negotiable)
- Test through public API exclusively
- Use factory functions for test data (no `let`/`beforeEach`)
- Tests must document expected business behavior
- No 1:1 mapping between test files and implementation files

For detailed testing patterns and examples, load the `testing` skill.

## TypeScript Guidelines

**Core principle**: Strict mode always. Schema-first at trust boundaries, types for internal logic.

**Quick reference:**
- No `any` types - ever (use `unknown` if type truly unknown)
- No type assertions without justification
- Prefer `type` over `interface` for data structures
- Reserve `interface` for behavior contracts only
- Define schemas first, derive types from them (Zod/Standard Schema)
- Use schemas at trust boundaries, plain types for internal logic

For detailed TypeScript patterns and rationale, load the `typescript-strict` skill.

## Code Style

**Core principle**: Functional programming with immutable data. Self-documenting code.

**Quick reference:**
- No data mutation - immutable data structures only
- Pure functions wherever possible
- No nested if/else - use early returns or composition
- No comments - code should be self-documenting
- Prefer options objects over positional parameters
- Use array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`) over loops

For detailed patterns and examples, load the `functional` skill.

## Development Workflow

**Core principle**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR in small, known-good increments. TDD is the fundamental practice.

**Quick reference:**
- RED: Write failing test first (NO production code without failing test)
- GREEN: Write MINIMUM code to pass test
- REFACTOR: Assess improvement opportunities (only refactor if adds value)
- **Wait for commit approval** before every commit
- Each increment leaves codebase in working state
- Capture learnings as they occur, merge at end

For detailed TDD workflow, load the `tdd` skill.
For refactoring methodology, load the `refactoring` skill.
For significant work, load the `planning` skill for three-document model (PLAN.md, WIP.md, LEARNINGS.md).

## Working with Claude

**Core principle**: Think deeply, follow TDD strictly, capture learnings while context is fresh.

**Quick reference:**
- ALWAYS FOLLOW TDD - no production code without failing test
- Assess refactoring after every green (but only if adds value)
- Update CLAUDE.md when introducing meaningful changes
- Ask "What do I wish I'd known at the start?" after significant changes
- Document gotchas, patterns, decisions, edge cases while context is fresh

For detailed TDD workflow, load the `tdd` skill.
For refactoring methodology, load the `refactoring` skill.
For detailed guidance on expectations and documentation, load the `expectations` skill.

## Summary

The key is to write clean, testable, functional code that evolves through small, safe increments. Every change should be driven by a test that describes the desired behavior, and the implementation should be the simplest thing that makes that test pass. When in doubt, favor simplicity and readability over cleverness.
