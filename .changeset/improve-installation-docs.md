Improve installation documentation order and clarity

**Fixed:**
- Option 3 now correctly uses v1.0.0 single-file version (v2.0.0 had broken imports)
- Installation options now ordered by recommendation (global install first, not third)
- Navigation table accurately describes each option's purpose

**Added:**
- Quick navigation table by user situation
- "Best for" and "Why choose this" sections for each option
- Clear tradeoffs for v1.0.0 vs v2.0.0 choice
- Workflow explanation before installation options
- Agent invocation examples integrated into workflow section

**Changed:**
- Moved version note to end of section (less critical information)
- Removed duplicate sections for cleaner structure
- First navigation row now says "I want this on all my personal projects" instead of misleading "I want this working in 30 seconds"
