Add OpenCode support for using CLAUDE.md guidelines with opencode.ai

- Added `opencode/.config/opencode/opencode.json` configuration file that loads CLAUDE.md and skills
- Added `--with-opencode` and `--opencode-only` flags to install-claude.sh
- Updated README.md with OpenCode integration documentation

OpenCode (https://opencode.ai) is an open source AI coding agent. This configuration allows OpenCode users to use the same CLAUDE.md guidelines and skills that work with Claude Code.
