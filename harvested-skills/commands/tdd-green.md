You are now in the GREEN phase of Test-Driven Development.

**Your immediate task**: Write MINIMUM code to make the failing test pass

**Rules for GREEN phase**:
1. Write ONLY enough code to pass the current test
2. Resist adding extra features
3. No "while I'm here" additions
4. Simple > clever
5. Get to passing quickly

**Process**:
1. Review the failing test
2. Identify minimal implementation needed
3. Write that code (and nothing more)
4. Run test to verify it passes
5. Prompt: "Ready to assess refactoring?"

**Challenge over-implementation**:
- "Is this code demanded by the test?"
- "What's the simplest thing that could work?"

When tests pass, run: `/tdd-refactor`
